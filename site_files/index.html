				<p>Welcome! This web archive contains 6000 images of decades' worth of magazine and newspaper content published by New Vision Printing & Publishing Company Limited (NVPPCL), a multimedia business started in March 1986 in Uganda.
        Dr. Caroline Faria and the Feminist Geography Collective at the University of Texas' Department of Geography and the Environment use these images as data for their work on Dr. Faria's NSF
        project concerning the beauty and fashion industry in Uganda. These images, aquired in Uganda in 2016, have been made available on this website to
        university students and faculty for their own research. Feel free to browse the web archive for images, or

					<p>
         Dr. Faria is a feminist geographer and Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography and the Environment at UT Austin. Her research brings together critical strands of geographic thought to interrogate the past-presents of nationalism, cosmopolitanism and neoliberal globalization. She views a postcolonial and intersectional lens as imperative, given its attentiveness to gender, race, class and sexual logics, their roots in and across place, their work producing and transforming national, ‘modern’, colonial and cosmopolitan subjects and spaces, and the efforts of women and others marginalized by these processes to negotiate, rework and resist. Her current research, funded by the National Science Foundation, examines the political-economies of the beauty industry in the Gulf-East African region.
         </p>
				 <p>
					 Her research and activist work are intertwined. A central imperative of her work is to support women and minority geographers, and those excited by geographic approaches but who may not see a place for themselves in the discipline. This work includes; building and sustaining faculty-student and peer-peer mentoring networks for undergraduates, graduates and fellow faculty; mentoring around research, writing, publication, and securing academic positions; and both writing on and practicing diverse geographic futures.
				 </p>
				 <p>
					 This work is grounded in part through the activities of the <a id="collectiveWebsite" href="https://universityoftexas.wixsite.com/femgeogcollective">Feminist Geography Collective</a> at UT, the Young and Emerging Scholars Task force (YES!) under the <a id="collectiveWebsite" href="https://igugender.wixsite.com/igugender">IGU – Gender Commission</a>, and varied collaborations and support networks with collectives, organizations, and research groups that share these feminist and anti-racist ethics.
				 </p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
				 <p>Our collective brings together faculty, graduate and undergraduate students from within and beyond Geography conducting research on power and place. Our research centers the politics of globalization and commodity flows. Our broader activist goal is to foster healthy, vibrant, and supportive academic spaces for feminist geographic research, to support the scholarship of women and minority students, and to connect to geographic, scholarly, and activist communities working globally.
			   </p>
				 <p>
					 We are passionate about feminist geographic thought and practice, and keen to make it public! We see this both as vital in nuancing debates around complex issues and in attracting women and students of color into the discipline of geography. To that end, we mix in and complement our academic research and publications, with public scholarship and outreach. This has included (and with support from the Public Fellows OpEd project) a series of opinion pieces on
					 <a id="collectiveWebsite" href="http://msmagazine.com/blog/2017/01/10/creek-murder-feminist-eye-geography-violence/">campus violence</a> and <a id="collectiveWebsite" href="https://www.tribtalk.org/2017/04/19/a-better-place-to-build-a-wall/">urban poverty and disinvestment</a>.
				 </p>
				 <p>
	         We have also presented a number of public lectures and interviews on our research, including on public scholarship and feminist practices, <a id="collectiveWebsite" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3HBYG8c98I">doing feminist political geography</a>, and <a id="collectiveWebsite" href="https://hairspunintogold.wordpress.com/2015/11/10/how-to-get-research-funding-as-an-undergrad/">finding undergraduate research funding</a>. Our efforts also focus on topics and conversations designed to get women and minority students excited about geography, and support them in becoming geographers. Enjoy and share!

       <li>
				 <p>
					 Our work with the collective takes two key forms: research and peer-mentoring / professional development.
				 </p>
				 <p>
				 Our research centers around the theme of globalization and commodity flows related to Dr. Faria's NSF-funded research on globalization in the Gulf-East African region. This project focuses on the hair and beauty industry connecting East Africa and the Gulf, and in particular Uganda and Dubai, UAE. It also highlights ways in which global processes are intricately intwined with and shaped by the intimate.​
			 </p>
			 <p>
				 Some examples of research-related work include:​
			 </p>
			 <ul>
         <li>Creating maps of shopping centers in Dubai</li>
         <li>Conducting literature reviews on topics relevant to Dr. Faria’s research and our own individual research</li>
         <li>Attending and presenting our research at UT based and national conferences, including the AAGs and the ASAs</li>
         <li>Transcribing interviews and focus groups</li>
				 <li>Conducting visual discourse analyses of images, advertisements, and archival materials</li>
				 <li>Developing our website, the IGU - Gender Commission website, and this web archive</li>
				 <li>Developing ties to other feminist geography research groups globally</li>
				 <li>Hosting guest speakers and workshopping guest scholars' papers</li>
			 </ul>
		  </li>
			<li><p>
				We are also committed to peer-mentoring and the professional development of women and minority geographers. Some examples of our work in this area include:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Organizing and participating in a panel session on Collectives at the 2017 Feminist Geography annual conference at UNC</li>
				<li>Conducting workshops on funding undergraduate research</li>
				<li>Peer-mentoring within the collective around poster design and research, panel organizing, academic publishing, research design, methods, and analysis</li>
				<li>Support in navigating graduate school applications</li>
				<li>Networking with feminist geography collectives globally</li>
